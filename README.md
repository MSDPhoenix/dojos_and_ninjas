# dojos_and_ninjas

This is a practice project.
I used project to practice Flask, git, and terminal commands, MySQL Workbench, and one-to-many relationships in the database.
There are many dojos and many ninjas.
One Dojo can have many ninjas, but one ninja can belong to only one dojo.
This is a one-to-many relationship.
